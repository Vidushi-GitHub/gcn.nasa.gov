The [Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM)](https://www.svom.eu/en/the-svom-mission/) is a French-Chinese mission, result of a collaboration between the two national space agencies, [China National Space Administration (CNSA)](https://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/index.html) and [Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES)](https://cnes.fr/en/projects/svom). SVOM mission is dedicated to the study of the the most powerful transient phenomena, with a particular emphasis on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

The SVOM spacecraft carries four multi-wavelength instruments: ECLAIRs, Gamma Ray burst Monitor (GRM), Microchannel X-ray Telescope (MXT) and Visual Telescope (VT). ECLAIRs and GRM can detect gamma-ray transient sources in real-time with localisation capabilities for ECLAIRs. SVOM can transfer the alerts in near real-time with a typical latency of less than 30s and perform autonomous slew to allow x-ray and optical follow-up of the source with the smaller field of view instruments: MXT and VT.

#### JSON-Serialized GCN Notice Types in GCN Kafka

SVOM distributes alerts and localizations detections of gamma-ray transients. These notices are published on the GCN Kafka and VOEvent topics as `gcn.notices.svom` and `gcn.notices.svom.voevent`, respectively.

#### Yearly Trigger Rates

 <div className="overflow-table">

| Instrument | Type                       | Yearly Rates |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| ECLAIRs    | GRBs, and other transients | 50 GRBs/yr   |
| GRM        | GRBs, and other transients | 90 GRBs/yr   |

Following a detection of an event by ECLAIRs or GRM, an automated analysis is performed on a subset of the intrument data to retrieve basic parameters of the burst e.g. T90 and hardness ratio. The results of this analysis is issued in the so-called `refined` notices. A classification of the event is also quickly estimated according to the following table and given with its associated probability:
